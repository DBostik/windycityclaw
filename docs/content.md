## 6. FAQ (Overcoming Objections)

**Q: Do I need to be technical to use this?**
A: Absolutely not. That's why we exist. Once we set it up, you interact with your agent just like you would an employee—via email, Slack, or chat. If you can send an email, you can use Windy City Claw.

**Q: Is it safe for my business data?**
A: OpenClaw is designed for privacy. Unlike ChatGPT, where your data trains their models, this runs in your own private environment. Tier 2 and 3 include our specific "Security Hardening" protocol used by enterprise clients.

**Q: What exactly can the agent do?**
A: Out of the box, it can manage your calendar, draft email replies, categorize your inbox, and answer questions based on your documents. With our custom workflows (Tier 2/3), we can teach it to qualify leads, draft contracts, or summarize daily news.

**Q: Why shouldn't I just use the $20/mo ChatGPT?**
A: ChatGPT is a chatbot. OpenClaw is an *agent*. It has access to your tools (Calendar, Email, Slack) and can *do* things, not just talk about them. It operates autonomously in the background.

**Q: What if I need help later?**
A: All tiers come with support periods. After that, we offer optional "Managed Care" plans starting at $99/mo to keep your agent updated and running smoothly, but they are completely optional.

## 7. About Me
**Headline:** From One Founder to Another
**Body:** "Hi, I’m Dave. I’m not a massive agency—I’m a Chicago-based builder who fell in love with how OpenClaw gave me my life back. I realized that while the tech is incredible, the setup is a barrier for the people who need it most: business owners. I started Windy City Claw to bridge that gap. My goal isn't to sell you software; it's to give you leverage."
